Algorithms in NLP
==============

A small sample of algorithms I implemented in CS 4740: Natural Language Processing.

hmm.py contains the Viterbi algorithm which is used to label polarity of sentences within unlabeled online movie reviews.
wsd.py contains the Lesk algorithm which is used to distinguish the sence of a word in a given sentence.
polarity.py contains the Naive-Bayes algorithm which is used to determine the polarity of a given hotel review.

These files, except for wsd.py, are not meant to be executed in isolation.
They are only my contribution to group projects. 
If you do wish to have the other files in order to execute these files,
feel free to email me at mim46@cornell.edu.
